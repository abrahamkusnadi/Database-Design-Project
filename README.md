# 🗄️ Database Design Project - Invoice Management System  

This repository contains our **Database Technology Final Project** at **Binus University**, focusing on designing and implementing a relational database for an **Invoice Management System**.  
The project applies **data normalization (UNF → 1NF → 2NF → 3NF)**, ERD modeling, SQL implementation, and visualization.

## 📌 Project Background
Invoices are essential in sales transactions, but poorly structured data often causes duplication, inconsistencies, and inefficiency.  
In this project, we normalized unstructured invoice data (UNF) into **3NF** to ensure:  
- Reduced data duplication  
- Improved data integrity  
- Easier data management  
- Better support for reporting & decision-making  

## 👨‍💻 My Contributions
In this project, I focused primarily on the **Data Preparation & Database Modeling** phases:
- **Data Collection & Scraping:** Collaborated in scraping and extracting the raw invoice data to construct the initial Unnormalized Form (UNF) dataset.
- **Functional Dependencies & Anomaly Detection:** Mapped out the functional dependencies (including partial and transitive dependencies) between attributes. I audited the dataset to identify insertion, update, and deletion anomalies, laying the structural groundwork for the team to process the 1NF to 3NF normalization.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Apply **normalization** from UNF → 1NF → 2NF → 3NF.  
- Design **ERD, logical, and physical diagrams**.  
- Implement database using **MySQL**.  
- Demonstrate **SQL queries, views, and constraints**.  
- Visualize insights from the database.

## 🧩 Methodology
1. **Data Collection** → 115 invoices simulated (INV001–INV115).  
2. **Unnormalized Form (UNF)** → Raw invoices stored in one table.  
3. **Normalization** → Step-by-step normalization up to 3NF.  
4. **Database Design** → ERD, logical schema, physical schema.  
5. **Implementation** → SQL scripts in MySQL.  
6. **Testing & Validation** → Queries for integrity and performance.

## 🔎 Implementation
- Built in **MySQL**.  
- Includes **Primary Keys, Foreign Keys, Constraints**.  
- Populated with 115 simulated invoices.  
- Tested with multiple **JOIN queries** and aggregation.

## 📊 Visualization
Visualization was performed using **Google Colab**, including:  
1. Total Sales by Product  
2. Total Sales by Salesperson  
3. Total Purchases by Customer  
4. Quantity of Sales per Product  
5. Frequency of Products Sold  


- Example Visualization Number 5

## ✅ Results
- A **well-structured, normalized database** free from redundancy.  
- **Efficient queries** for transaction reports.  
- **Visualization dashboards** showing key insights.  

---

## 📝 Future Improvements
- Add **product variants** (size, color, categories).  
- Implement **stock inventory management**.  
- Expand **ID formatting** for scalability.
